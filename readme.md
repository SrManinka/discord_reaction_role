Make your bot give a role based in the user's reaction

## Requirements

- Node.js

## Setup

First, [create and invite your bot to your server](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html), edit 'config.json' and write your bot's token where is writen "your_bot_token"  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

After saving the file, install all dependeces needed with:
```javascript
npm install
```
and finally start the bot using

```javascript
npm start
```
## Usage

After seeing your bot online in discord, write a message in the channel you want people to react to get a role, write "!!create" to start the process(you can change "!!" and "create message" in config.json file).
